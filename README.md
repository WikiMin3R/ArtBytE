What is ArtBytE?
----------------

ArtBytE is a digital peer-to-peer network that enables instant transfers to
anyone, anywhere in the world. ArtBytE is based on trustless verification 
technology, designed to operate with no central authority: managing transfers 
and issuing new UTXOs are carried out collectively by the network. ArtBytE Core 
is the name of software which enables the use of this peer-to-peer network.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the ArtBytE Core software, see https://www.artbyte.art

Starting Jan 1, 2022 the project is curated by EWMCI - A network of volunteer
crypto enthusiasts. See ewmci.info
