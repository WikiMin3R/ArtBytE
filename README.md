-= GENERAL INFO =-

Greetings Visitors!
On March 1, 2022 Artbyte will transition to hybrid PoW (Scrypt) / PoS protocol.
This will require a non-inflationary 1:1 old-to-new Artbyte swap, with a window of 3 months (90 days).
We look forward to growing this project and making incremental enhancements.
Since 2018, Artbyte (ABY) is a part of the EWMCI Crypto Leadership Alliance (see alliance.ewmci.info)
Ongoing updates will be added to the original code and will be posted here:  http://github.com/WikiMin3R/ArtBytE
New website (Go-Live planed for mid-March, 2022) will be at https://artbyte.art
