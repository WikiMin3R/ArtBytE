Greetings Visitors!

On March 1, 2022 Artbyte will transition to hybrid PoW (Scrypt) / PoS protocol.

This will require a non-inflationary 1:1 old-to-new Artbyte swap, with a window of 3 months (90 days).

We look forward to growing this project and making incremental enhancements.

Since 2018, Artbyte (ABY) is a part of the EWMCI Crypto Leadership Alliance (see alliance.ewmci.info)

Ongoing updates will be added to the original code and will be posted here:  http://github.com/WikiMin3R/ArtBytE
